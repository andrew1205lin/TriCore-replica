# TriCore-replica

This repo is a replication of paper ["TRICORE: Parallel Triangle Counting on GPUs"](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~howie/publications/TriCore-SC18.pdf).
I am not the author, just try to implement it.

TODO:

- [ ] Read the graph and convert it into CSR or other requird format.
- [ ] Count the triangle on CPU to verify the algorithm.
- [ ] Write the CUDA kernel.
- [ ] Profile the time cost.
